## Knowledge

- **Workspace**: The place where you usually store your project code.
- **Index / Stage**: For temporarily storing your changes. In fact, it is just a file that holds information about the files that are about to be committed.
- **Repository**: A safe place to store data. It contains all the versions of data that you have committed. The HEAD points to the latest version that was put into the repository.
- **Remote**: The server that hosts the code. It can be simply thought of as a computer in your project team used for remote data exchange.
